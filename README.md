Assignment

I was unable to complete the full assignment due to my demanding work schedule, as I have been working more than 10 hours per day at my company. Given these extensive work commitments, I could only start the assignment on Sunday morning, which left me with insufficient time to complete it as required. I sincerely apologize for the delay and any inconvenience this may have caused. I appreciate your understanding and would be grateful for any additional time to complete the remaining work. Please let me know if there are any alternatives or adjustments I can make to meet expectations.
